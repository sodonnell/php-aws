# php-aws
Simple AWS API Client Scripts (more like examples) written in PHP.

These scripts are intended to be used as tools and not part of a composer package or 3rd party framework. These are intended more as a boilerplate set of scripts to help initiate the integration of AWS into existing codebases.

## Install
```
git clone https://github.com/sodonnell/php-aws.git
cd php-aws
composer install
```
