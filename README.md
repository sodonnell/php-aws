# php-aws
Simple AWS API Client Scripts written in PHP.

These scripts are intended to be used as tools and not part of a composer package or 3rd party framework. These are intended more as a boilerplate set of scripts to help initiate the integration of AWS into existing codebases.

## Install the AWS PHP SDK package
```
cd /path/to/project
composer require aws/aws-sdk-php
```
